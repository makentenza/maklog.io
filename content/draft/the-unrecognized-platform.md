It has been almost 3 years when I started playing with OpenShift/k8s and a bit more with what we call now Linux Containers. During this period (mostly at Red Hat) I've helped Customers from many different industries to move their workloads to OpenShift. I had the opportunity to work on both greedfield and brownfield projects, move or create simple microservices to run in OpenShift and take advantage of the features the platform brings to accelerate the development process, or brake old big monolithics into small microservices and build a CI/CD ecosystem around them. These are, reduced to the minimal expression, the typical use cases so far when using OpenShift/k8s. I recently had the opportunity to work on diferent use cases where we sucessfuly demostrated that the platform limits and posibilities are still not discovered.
