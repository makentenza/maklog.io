      <title>Open Source Summit Europe 2017</title>

      <description>This was the first Open Source Summit for me, and for everyone in Europe. The formerly &amp;lsquo;LinuxCon&amp;rsquo; has been re-branded as it now covers topics beyond Linux such as Containers and Cloud. So LinuxCon, ContainerCon and CloudOpen are now under the same event.
Apart from the morning KeyNotes, I mostly attend talks around ContainerCon and CloudOpen tracks. The hot topic as expected during the whole conference was around containers and Kubernetes, so the majority of the talks had references to these technologies or they were directly around them.</description>
