      <title>Creating snapshots in AWS for OpenShift Persistent Volumes</title>

      <description>Even microservices where thought to be used as stateless services, the requirement to persist the data is growing exponentially. Kubernetes and OpenShift facilitate this through persistent volumes and persistent volume claims.
We can use multiple volume plugins to automatically provision these volumes on different storage backends, giving users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure. This is really cool from a user/developer point of view, but the groups that take care of the PaaS environment would need to implement some backup strategies for the critical data.</description>

      <title>Open Source Summit Europe 2017</title>

      <description>This was the first Open Source Summit for me, and for everyone in Europe. The formerly &amp;lsquo;LinuxCon&amp;rsquo; has been re-branded as it now covers topics beyond Linux such as Containers and Cloud. So LinuxCon, ContainerCon and CloudOpen are now under the same event.
Apart from the morning KeyNotes, I mostly attend talks around ContainerCon and CloudOpen tracks. The hot topic as expected during the whole conference was around containers and Kubernetes, so the majority of the talks had references to these technologies or they were directly around them.</description>
